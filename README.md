# pytco-frontend

## Contributing
To have a development environment up and running, do the following:

```
$ npm install
$ grunt
```

Now you have `pytco-frontend` Docker container running, and you can access it
via browser at http://localhost:8000

NOTE: Everytime you make a change to one of the files under `app/` Grunt will
automatically build it into the Docker container and run it for you.
