	The Penn Yan Theatre Company was created in 1978 and has provided Penn Yan and the surrounding community years of popular entertainment through their successful community theatre group.<br>
	<br>
	PYTCo delivers quality musicals throughout the year including variety shows, musicals and plays to enthusiastic audiences numbering 500 to 1,000 or more per production. The productions offer unique and affordable live shows to the Penn Yan public that is an experience not duplicated elsewhere in the local community.<br>
	<br>
	PYTCo has succeeded by countless hours of volunteer support and the generosity of the community. PYTCo volunteers are from ages five to seventy-five. These volunteers are taught the production process, including; performance, costume, makeup, set design and building, promotion, ticket sales, and house management.
