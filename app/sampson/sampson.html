				<p>The Sampson Theatre is a highly visible anchor in the Penn Yan village commercial district located at 126 East Elm Street. It is an architecturally and historical significant theatre, a rare surviving example of a vaudeville house. It was built in 1910 by a local benefactor, Dr. Frank Sampson.<br>
				<br>
				For 20 years the Sampson was the center of entertainment and live stage productions in Penn Yan. But with the advent of the depression and coming of motion pictures its use as a theater ended. Since 1930 the building was used for other purposes and the interior was altered. The most recent use was as a tire store run by the Trombley family. The Trombley family gifted the Sampson to PYTCo in 2004 with the purpose to return the building to its original use as an entertainment center.<br>
				<br>
				The Sampson is listed in the State and National Registers of Historic Places. It is an important example of the early use of poured concrete construction which was unusual in a small town setting. This concrete has allowed the main frame of the building to survive in relatively good condition.<br>
				<br>
				The Sampson Theatre was selected as one of the Landmark Society’s Inaugural “Five to Revive” as a priority for preservation.
